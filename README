NAME
    Net::WhitePages - A Perl interface to the WhitePages.com API

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::WhitePages;

        my $wp = Net::WhitePages->new(TOKEN => "12345");
        my $res = $wp->find_person(lastname => "Wall", firstname => "Larry");

DESCRIPTION
    "Net::WhitePages" provides a simple perl wrapper for the whitepages.com
    API (see http://developer.whitepages.com/ for details). The interface
    matches the API exactly; see http://developer.whitepages.com/docs for a
    description of it.

    You'll need to have a whitepages.com API token to function; see
    http://developer.whitepages.com/ for a sign-up link and terms of
    service.

    WhitePages.com places strict usage limitations, which this module does
    not attempt to enforce.

METHODS
    find_person
        Search by a person's name and location to find the person's complete
        address and phone number. See
